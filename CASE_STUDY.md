# Case Study: Scaling Llama-3 Chat Assistants with GPTQ Quantization

## Executive Summary

Innova successfully reduced operational costs by 68% while maintaining 98% quality parity for a large-scale chat assistant deployment serving 100K+ daily active users. Using GPTQ 4-bit quantization on Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we achieved 2.4× throughput improvement and 75% memory reduction, enabling deployment on commodity GPUs.

## Client Context

**Industry**: Enterprise SaaS
**Challenge**: Scale AI chat assistants to 100K DAU within existing infrastructure budget
**Constraints**:
- Fixed GPU fleet (8× NVIDIA A6000 nodes)
- P95 latency requirement: <100ms for 32-token generations
- Quality requirement: >95% user satisfaction score
- Budget: $50K/month infrastructure cost ceiling

## Objective

Transform the existing FP16 Llama-3 deployment to support 2-4× more concurrent users while:
1. Maintaining conversation quality (measured by user feedback and automated metrics)
2. Reducing per-request latency by 40%
3. Staying within existing infrastructure budget
4. Enabling longer context windows (8K → 32K tokens)

## Method

### Quantization Pipeline

We implemented a systematic GPTQ quantization approach:

1. **Calibration Data Curation**:
   - Sampled 512 representative conversations from production logs
   - Ensured coverage of all major use cases (support, sales, technical)
   - Validated against diversity metrics (topic, length, complexity)

2. **Quantization Configuration**:
   ```python
   config = GPTQConfig(
       bits=4,
       group_size=128,
       desc_act=True,  # Activation order for better quality
       damp_percent=0.01,
       true_sequential=True
   )
   ```

3. **Prompt Tuning**:
   - Fine-tuned system prompts to compensate for quantization artifacts
   - A/B tested 5 prompt variations with 1000 users each
   - Selected optimal prompt with +2.3% satisfaction improvement

4. **Deployment Architecture**:
   ```
   Load Balancer (nginx)
           ↓
   vLLM Servers (8 nodes)
           ↓
   GPTQ Models (4-bit)
           ↓
   Shared KV Cache (Redis)
   ```

   - 512 samples optimal (diminishing returns beyond)
   - Diversity more important than quantity

2. **Group Size Trade-offs**
   - 128 group size optimal for our workload
   - Smaller groups (64) gave +0.5% quality but -8% speed
   - Larger groups (256) gave +3% speed but -2% quality

3. **KV Cache Optimization Critical**
   - Shared KV cache across instances saved 30% memory
   - Paged attention reduced memory fragmentation by 40%
   - Dynamic batching improved throughput by 25%

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Inconsistent generation quality for technical queries
   - **Solution**: Separate routing for technical vs general queries
   - **Result**: +4% satisfaction on technical support tickets

2. **Challenge**: Cold start latency increased to 3.2s
   - **Solution**: Model warmup on container start + preloaded KV cache
   - **Result**: Cold start reduced to 0.8s

3. **Challenge**: Quantization affected few-shot learning capability
   - **Solution**: Increased few-shot examples from 3 to 5
   - **Result**: Restored 95% of original few-shot performance

### Best Practices Discovered

1. **Staged Rollout**: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% over 2 weeks

## Conclusion

GPTQ 4-bit quantization proved to be a game-changer for scaling our Llama-3 deployment. The 68% cost reduction and 2.4× throughput improvement exceeded initial projections, while maintaining acceptable quality levels. The success has led to organization-wide adoption of quantization as a standard optimization technique.

The key insight: **quantization is not just about compression, but about unlocking new capabilities** - longer contexts, more concurrent users, and lower latency - that improve the overall product experience while reducing costs.
